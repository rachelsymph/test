## Contributing

**1. Create a branch off of `main`**

Name the branch using the following guidelines:

- `feature/branch-name` - For code that adds features. May include tests.
- `fix/branch-name` - For code that fixes a broken feature.
- `fixtest/branch-name` - For code that fixes a broken test.
- `misc/branch-name` - For code clean up and refactoring changes that don't fix bugs or add new features.
- `test/branch-name` - For code that only adds tests.
- `adjustment/branch-name` - For code that changes an existing working feature.

**2. Do your stuff**

Make commits according to its purpose. For example, if you are building a new feature, don't do code cleanup. Do code cleanup in a separate commit (or better separate branch)

Commit message template: `[Commit Type][Author] Add user login`

*Commit types:*

* Feature
* Fix
* Fix Test
* Misc
* Test
* Adjustment

**3. When ready, create a Pull Request from your branch to `main` branch.**
